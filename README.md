A Gorilla Tag mod that lets you move around the camera with WASD.

The LIV camera works fine with this mod. (Lmk if there is bugs [here](<https://github.com/defaultuser0-nerd/PCSpectate/issues>))

All you need to do to enable it is with a small button in the top right corner.

You can also change the FOV and speed in the config file.
